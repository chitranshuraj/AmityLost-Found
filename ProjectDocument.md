# AmityLost-Found
# Abstract
Web Development is one of the most demanding fields in the era of computers and technology. It is incorporated by a lot of people around the world, which also makes it one of the most trending fields in Computers and Programming. Every business, company or an organisation requires a website to connect itself to the world. With a population of more than 7.6 billion and still rising, web development is in huge demand among every age group, no matter what place or what country. 
		This project titled “Amity Lost & Found Portal” is a simple idea which is being used to connect the individuals of all the branches in Amity University for solving an easy yet a most popular problem, Lost and Found items. This portal is a digital approach to connect a person who has lost his/her item in the campus with the person who has found his/her item on the campus. 
			This project is developed in order to understand each and every concept of website development. This project teaches us how to design a website, how to add processing modules and what all goes into the backend programming while developing a website. This project provides us with an insight into the huge world of Internet and its components. 
				This project also gives us an insight into how large organisations function and how the management system takes care of such small issues and solves them. Amity University has one of the largest management cells in the country, this project helps us to understand the system of the organisation. 
        
# Introduction
Web Development is a term which is used to define the work that is involved in developing a website for the Internet (ie. World Wide Web) or developing a private network that functions inside an organisation or a corporation. Web development is a very diverse field, which ranges from developing static pages to the development of the most intricate web applications.  A more comprehensive list of tasks Web Development consists of are, front-end development, back-end development and full-stack development. 
This project is developed in order to understand the concepts of designing and managing layouts of a website, while dealing with the functionality of a website and creating functions in order to manage the information collected from the webpage. This project has been developed using HTML5 which is a mark-up language and is a base for every other website that is there on the World Wide Web. The designing and layout managing of the website has been achieved using CSS3, a language used solely for designing a website. The functionality of the website and data collection has been achieved using the concepts of PHP whereas the server implementation of the website has been incorporated using XAMPP, a free source Apache server. 
XAMPP is an approach that is used to make a server for the website; it is used to transfer data and information processed by PHP, to the user as well as the developers.
The central idea that went into developing an “Amity Lost & Found Portal” was to help the students and professors in Amity University to get back their lost items or goods in a more digital and easy way. Although there is a lost & found cell in the university, but a very few people know about its location and its functioning. The Website is developed in the mirror of giants like OLX & Quikr, which work on the principle of displaying requests on their portal; the request is visible to a huge mass and the interested entity can contact the person who has posted the request, digitally. The “Amity Lost & Found Portal” displays the request and provides full assistance in getting the lost item back to its rightful owner.
		Before the completion of the project, various problems were encountered, a lot of intensive coding went into developing the webpage, new errors were tackled and the code was optimized while lowering the complexity of the webpage. This helped in developing a lot of problem solving skills along with the improvement in coding and learning a lot while developing a working webpage.

# Overview of the Webpage

AIM:

Amity University has set up milestones at the Global Education Level, delivering intricate and amiable education to its large student body on a Global level. The University offers its students a paramount number of curricular and extra-curricular activities with a diverse number of branches and departments. With 15+ education blocks and hostels, Amity University marvels at its best management skills.

In this age of technology, there's a website or a portal for every student need; but not a well-developed portal for the lost items. With many students losing their belongings, it is difficult to keep a track of the distribution of those lost items. The University has a small lost & found room in all its blocks, but the task to locate them is very tedious and time consuming. With the highest number of students, a mini metropolitan needs to establish a digital approach towards the lost & found items of the students. Reaching out to a needy person and helping them get back what they lost, is the most noblest of the deeds.

Why was it made?
•	To make a digital portal of University’s Lost & Found 
•	To reduce the time-gap between the person who has lost something
with respect to  the person who has found the item
•	To be used by any age group, be it students or faculty 
•	To use the knowledge of Computers and Technology for a noble cause

Conclusion:

Using the knowledge of Web Development, Amity Lost & Found Portal came into being. This portal can be a huge help to all the students and faculty in Amity University, for locating their lost belongings. It will allow the students to focus on their studies rather than roaming the entire University in search of their lost item. This will also create an atmosphere of companionship among the students and faculty. 
Amity Lost & Found Cell can incorporate this research in their management system, so that the actions could be more swift and systematic as well as interactive. 
However, there are still some improvements and developments that can go into “Amity Lost & Found”, like the inclusion of Jscript and Angular.js modules with the addition of further designing tools as well. An application can be dedicated to the website as well.
